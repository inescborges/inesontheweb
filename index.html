    <title>InÃªs On The Web</title>

<h1>I'm a 27 year old whose child isn't dead. I work in the tech field because you can make awesome things out of it and use the web to give
    great feelings with your creativity. That's why I chose the frontend role. I wish I had more knowledge on how to design websites, but at least I have my ideas (which are many times so hard to put in the real world). I try my very best.
    I also love to do things where cash doesn't come quick: singing and writing.
    Welcome to my bittersweet being :)</h1>
